# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

Currently I am corporate guy working in software industry. That might sound a little boring but I do keep exploring things from time to time apart from sitting in front of my computer just hitting keyboard keys day and night. I love to watch some movies which could be dramas, romance, comedy, action, thriller or pretty much anything. I love to sing and I believe, I am not that terrible, people do praise me for that at the least. One other major change in my life was to start gymming which pretty much changed the life and also how I look.

In terms of technical hobbies I like to study Computer Science and it's applications in various other fields, kind of domain driven engineering. I also like to study Physics to understand Universe in a better way in my free time.
